Nailed it Designs Bedrock Responsive Framework

License & Disclaimer

Bedrock is an open source development and a redistribution of predominantly the best bits of Zurbs Foundation 4 and Twitters Bootstrap.

We tried to be as open an honest about this as possible and have annotated who owns what code within all of our source files. Nailed It Design Ltd do not in any way claim to be the creators of this software in its entirety. We have also by the same token.

In Summary Nailed It Design’s Bedrock should be taken as more of a tutorial in how to get the best out of both Zurbs Foundation 4 and Twitters Bootstrap 3
